create mapping between column and available stats on it

enum --> count
float --> avg, std
text --> length, topic model???


do decile for all rows and all rows with similar foreign key


Good ideas:
- propose prediction problems
- explain factors leading to label
- study which patterns of variables most often are exlcuded
- interval problem
- do something around finding the user table

- corruption from shared path
- temporal stuff

feature pruning, semantic features
- variance





what if sum and count aren't correlected
what if things we expect to correlate don't?

# func.std(column).label('std.'+label),
# func.max(column).label('max.'+label),
# func.min(column).label('min.'+label),
# func.sum(column).label('sum.'+label),
# func.count(column).label('count.'+label),


# shopify add on

	
cluster and then try to predict





kalyan 2/27
- focus on time features and doing a predict
- transfer learning from one database to another
