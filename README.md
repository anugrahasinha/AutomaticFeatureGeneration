# Data-Science-Machine
Original Code from Max Kanter's master's thesis at MIT.

Data-Sciences-Machine code has been forked out of : https://github.com/HDI-Project/Data-Science-Machine
Deep Mining Code has been forked out of : https://github.com/sds-dubois/DeepMining
   
   Deep Mining code has been specifically checked out from : https://github.com/sds-dubois/DeepMining/tree/cea2981f4b08d8a1dc5f3a153d1222a368062885
   The commit tree is important for this DSM working as other Deep Mining libraries do not provide what is needed for DSM code.
   

Further enhancements has been done on original code to build inbuild data structure for greater understanding of feature generated
by data sciences machine.

This is still an on going project.
Performance results will be shared soon.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
1) There are important dependencies that the code has. It works on custom systems after all dependency resolution
2) Database connections are hard coded and not configurable as of now. <TBD>
3) Other customization for final product are still in progress.
